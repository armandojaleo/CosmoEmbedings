# 🗺️ Roadmap – CosmicEmbeddings

This roadmap outlines the short-, mid-, and long-term milestones for the CosmicEmbeddings project.

---

## ✅ Phase 0 – Bootstrapping (Done)

- [x] Define block structure and validation protocol
- [x] Specify node behavior and sync mechanism
- [x] Design SDK interface (Python)
- [x] Implement local node simulator and test client
- [x] Add CLI tools and web UI
- [x] Create project documentation and structure

---

## 🚧 Phase 1 – SDK & Node MVP (In Progress)

- [ ] Implement real embedding generation in `block_builder.py`
- [ ] Add cryptographic signature with real Ed25519 keys
- [ ] Fetch and compute real cosmic signature from astronomy APIs
- [ ] Validate blocks end-to-end from SDK to nodes
- [ ] Add CLI options for block creation and querying
- [ ] Publish SDK to PyPI

---

## 🔄 Phase 2 – Network and Interoperability

- [ ] Implement peer trust and reputation heuristics
- [ ] Add node persistence (file/db storage)
- [ ] Create peer-to-peer node discovery protocol
- [ ] Enable syncing with external tools (LangChain, HuggingFace, etc.)
- [ ] Support multiple embedding formats with conversion

---

## 🌍 Phase 3 – Distributed Network

- [ ] Deploy public testnet with multiple running nodes
- [ ] Publish validator tools and verification registry
- [ ] Add relay nodes and bridge protocols for federation
- [ ] Launch contribution portal and community onboarding

---

## 🌌 Phase 4 – Cosmic Embedding Ecosystem

- [ ] Launch a live, trusted knowledge registry
- [ ] Visual explorer of embeddings and relationships
- [ ] Decentralized governance and extension voting
- [ ] Cross-language (Rust, Go, JS) SDKs
