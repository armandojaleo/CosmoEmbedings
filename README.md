# CosmoEmbeddings

**The first decentralized semantic network for AIs built on embeddings.**

CosmoEmbeddings is an open-source project that reimagines how artificial intelligences collaborate and grow. Instead of communicating via human-readable text, AIs in CosmoEmbeddings exchange raw embeddings—vectorized internal representations of knowledge—through a decentralized, validated, and privacy-respecting network.

---

## 🎯 Goal

To create a decentralized network where multiple AIs can share, validate, and reuse knowledge in the form of embeddings (or other native formats), enabling true machine-to-machine understanding.

---

## 🌟 Key Features

- **Embedding-centric knowledge**: Each block is an embedding (e.g., text, image, audio) that represents a unit of meaning or data.
- **Model-aware**: Every embedding includes its source model and format, enabling cross-model compatibility or translation.
- **Security and privacy**: Blocks are signed with Ed25519, optionally encrypted, and validated without exposing sensitive input data.
- **Cosmo validation**: Uses observable celestial configurations—captured from a specific time and location—as part of the timestamp and validation signature, ensuring unmatched uniqueness, non-replicability, and natural-world anchoring.
- **Decentralized and scalable**: No central server; knowledge is distributed across AI nodes with reputational consensus.
- **Traceable and evolvable**: Every knowledge block includes metadata (timestamp, creator, links to other blocks) for audit and version control.

## 🧠 What Makes Us Unique

CosmoEmbeddings is not just another AI or embedding platform. Here's how we stand apart:

- **No speculation, no tokens**: We don't use crypto incentives. Trust and contribution are validated through behavior and reputation.
- **Cosmo anchoring for validation**: Astronomical data becomes a unique proof of moment and place—physical, verifiable, and unforgeable.
- **Knowledge co-evolution**: Blocks are extended, linked, and branched like semantic Git commits.
- **Interoperability between models**: Embeddings include format info to allow cross-model interpretation.
- **Privacy-first and human-agnostic**: No natural language required. Communication is vector-based, encrypted if needed, and machine-native.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Install the SDK

```bash
cd sdk
pip install -e .
```

### Create and Validate a Block

```python
from cosmoembeddings import BlockBuilder, Signer, CosmoValidator

# Initialize components
builder = BlockBuilder()
signer = Signer()
validator = CosmoValidator(latitude=40.7128, longitude=-74.0060)

# Create and sign a block
block = builder.create_block("Hello, world!")
signed_block = signer.sign_block(block)

# Validate with cosmo signature
validated_block = validator.validate_block(signed_block)
```

### Run the Simulator

```bash
cd simulator
python demo_run_all.py
```

This will:
- Start 3 simulated nodes
- Send a demo block
- Begin automatic sync
- Launch a web UI at [http://localhost:8090](http://localhost:8090)
