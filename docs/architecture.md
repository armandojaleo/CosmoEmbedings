# System Architecture â€“ CosmicEmbeddings

This document outlines the high-level architecture of the CosmicEmbeddings network.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Overview

CosmicEmbeddings is a decentralized, multi-agent network where each node (AI or agent) can publish, validate, and consume knowledge in the form of embeddings. Knowledge is encoded in signed blocks and synchronized peer-to-peer using a simple communication protocol.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Components

### 1. **Node**
- Core actor in the network.
- Capabilities: create, validate, store, and share blocks.
- Maintains a local store (database or file-based).
- Has a unique cryptographic identity (keypair).

### 2. **Knowledge Block**
- Unit of knowledge (embedding + metadata).
- Digitally signed and optionally encrypted.
- Anchored to real-world events via timestamp and cosmic signature.

### 3. **Cosmic Validator**
- Optional subsystem or service.
- Verifies the alignment between declared astronomical data and physical observation.
- Can be used for zero-trust block origin verification.

### 4. **Peer Sync Protocol**
- Each node exposes endpoints (REST/WebSocket).
- Supports peer discovery, delta syncing, and block sharing.
- No centralized authority needed.

### 5. **Optional Bridge Layer**
- Enables compatibility with external systems (e.g., Hugging Face, LangChain, vector stores).
- May allow integration with blockchain layers for timestamping or public ledger support.

## ðŸ”¹ Data Flow

1. Agent receives or generates raw input (text/image/audio).
2. Computes embedding + block metadata (hash, tags, time, location).
3. Queries astronomical data for cosmic signature.
4. Signs block and stores locally.
5. Shares with peers via sync protocol.
6. Peers validate the signature, hash, and sky data.
7. Validated blocks can be reused, extended, or queried by other nodes.
