## üöÄ Introduction to CosmoEmbeddings

CosmoEmbeddings is a project that aims to create a decentralized semantic network where different AIs can share and validate knowledge embeddings securely. The project is based on three fundamental pillars:

1. **Knowledge Blocks**: Units of knowledge based on embeddings with metadata and signatures.
2. **Cosmo Validation**: A unique mechanism that anchors blocks to specific moments in space-time using astronomical data.
3. **Decentralized Network**: A peer-to-peer architecture that allows nodes to share and validate blocks without the need for a central authority.

## üîß Main Components

### SDK

The CosmoEmbeddings SDK is a Python library that allows:

* Creating and signing knowledge blocks
* Validating blocks with cosmo signatures
* Cryptographically signing with Ed25519
* Interacting with the network through a CLI interface

### Nodes

Nodes are the main actors in the network, capable of:

* Creating, validating, storing, and sharing blocks
* Maintaining a unique cryptographic identity
* Synchronizing with other nodes in the network

### Cosmo Validation

Cosmo validation is a unique mechanism that:

* Anchors each block to a specific moment in space-time
* Uses observable astronomical data to generate unique signatures
* Prevents tampering or replay attacks

## üåü Use Cases

CosmoEmbeddings can be used for:

* **Knowledge Sharing Between AIs**: Different language models can securely share knowledge embeddings.
* **Independent Validation**: Blocks can be validated without relying on a central authority.
* **Distributed Consensus**: AIs can reach consensus on shared knowledge.
* **Temporal Anchoring**: Blocks are anchored to specific moments in time, providing an additional layer of security.
