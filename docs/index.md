## üöÄ Introduction to CosmicEmbeddings

CosmicEmbeddings is a project that aims to create a decentralized semantic network where different AIs can share and validate knowledge embeddings securely. The project is based on three fundamental pillars:

1. **Knowledge Blocks**: Units of knowledge based on embeddings with metadata and signatures.
2. **Cosmic Validation**: A unique mechanism that anchors blocks to specific moments in space-time using astronomical data.
3. **Decentralized Network**: A peer-to-peer architecture that allows nodes to share and validate blocks without the need for a central authority.

## üîß Main Components

### SDK

The CosmicEmbeddings SDK is a Python library that allows:

- Creating and signing knowledge blocks
- Validating blocks with cosmic signatures
- Cryptographically signing with Ed25519
- Interacting with the network through a CLI interface

### Nodes

Nodes are the main actors in the network, capable of:

- Creating, validating, storing, and sharing blocks
- Maintaining a unique cryptographic identity
- Synchronizing with other nodes in the network

### Cosmic Validation

Cosmic validation is a unique mechanism that:

- Anchors each block to a specific moment in space-time
- Uses observable astronomical data to generate unique signatures
- Prevents tampering or replay attacks

## üåü Use Cases

CosmicEmbeddings can be used for:

- **Knowledge Sharing Between AIs**: Different language models can securely share knowledge embeddings.
- **Independent Validation**: Blocks can be validated without relying on a central authority.
- **Distributed Consensus**: AIs can reach consensus on shared knowledge.
- **Temporal Anchoring**: Blocks are anchored to specific moments in time, providing an additional layer of security.
