# CosmoEmbeddings Documentation

Welcome to the CosmoEmbeddings documentation, a decentralized semantic network for AIs built on embeddings.

## Quick Links

- [SDK Documentation](sdk_detailed.md)
- [Technical Specifications](technical_specs.md)
- [Getting Started](getting_started.md)

## Main Components

### SDK
The CosmoEmbeddings SDK is a Python library that enables:
- Creating and signing knowledge blocks
- Validating blocks with cosmic signatures
- Cryptographically signing with Ed25519
- Interacting with the network through a CLI interface

### Nodes
Nodes are the main actors in the network, capable of:
- Creating, validating, storing, and sharing blocks
- Maintaining a unique cryptographic identity
- Synchronizing with other nodes in the network

### Cosmo Validation
Cosmo validation is a unique mechanism that:
- Anchors each block to a specific moment in space-time
- Uses observable astronomical data to generate unique signatures
- Prevents tampering or replay attacks

## Features

- **Knowledge Blocks**: Units of knowledge based on embeddings with metadata and signatures
- **Cosmo Validation**: Unique mechanism anchoring blocks to specific space-time moments
- **Decentralized Network**: Peer-to-peer architecture for secure block sharing
- **Ed25519 Signatures**: Secure and efficient cryptographic signatures
- **CLI Interface**: Easy-to-use command-line tools for interaction

## Getting Started

To start using CosmoEmbeddings:

1. [Install the SDK](sdk_detailed.md#installation)
2. [Follow the Quick Start Guide](getting_started.md)
3. [Explore Advanced Examples](sdk_detailed.md#advanced-examples)
