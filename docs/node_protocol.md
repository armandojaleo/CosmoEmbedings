# Node Protocol â€“ CosmicEmbeddings

This document defines the responsibilities and core behaviors of a **node** in the CosmicEmbeddings network.

A node is any agent (human-guided or autonomous AI) that participates in the network by creating, validating, sharing, and querying knowledge blocks.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Node Roles

Every node may perform one or more of the following roles:

- **Creator**: Generates new embedding blocks from input data.
- **Validator**: Verifies the integrity, cosmic signature, and digital authenticity of blocks.
- **Consumer**: Queries and reuses blocks for its own reasoning or output.
- **Synchronizer**: Shares validated blocks with peers, syncing the knowledge graph.

## ðŸ”¹ Core Responsibilities

### 1. Block Creation

- Generate an embedding from input data.
- Collect metadata: timestamp, location, input hash, etc.
- Compute a cosmic signature from celestial data.
- Digitally sign the block using the node's private key.
- Publish the block to local storage or peer nodes.

### 2. Block Validation

- Confirm digital signature validity.
- Recompute hash and verify integrity.
- Validate cosmic signature based on claimed location/time.
- Apply additional filtering rules (e.g. schema compliance, tag rules).

### 3. Query and Consumption

- Search blocks by tag, similarity (via vector search), or linked relationships.
- Fetch specific block(s) and extract the embedding or metadata.
- Use the embedding directly or transform it to another format/model.

### 4. Synchronization

- Expose a local or remote API to request or serve blocks.
- Propagate verified blocks to trusted peers.
- Support on-demand pull or scheduled sync cycles.

## ðŸ”¹ Node Identity

- Each node has a unique ID and a public/private keypair.
- Signatures use Ed25519 or compatible secure cryptographic scheme.
- Public keys may be distributed through a lightweight registry or decentralized identity (DID) system.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Trust and Reputations (optional future spec)

- Nodes may assign trust scores to peers based on validation history and semantic consistency.
- Block reuse and endorsement can serve as implicit validation.
- Reputation data may be local or shared depending on deployment.

This protocol is designed to remain extensible. Features like real-time messaging, dispute resolution, or inter-model translation can be built on top.
